Notes WinHelp-version:
----------------------
  Since the WinHelp version is converted from HTML the result may not
  always be the best.

Notes HTML version:
-------------------
  It contains long filenames. Will not work fully with filesystems that
  the uses 8.3 convention (MS-DOS).

Notes Amiga HTML version:
-------------------------
  It has been tested with AWeb II and IBrowse v1.02 and worked fully.
  Since the HTML code doesn't contain any "advanced" HTML-tags it should
  work with most browsers. Sorry, but some filenames are longer than
  30 characters (which is a limit in AmigaOS). Will be fixed ASAP.

Notes PDF (Adobe Acrobat) version:
----------------------------------
  Consider this as Beta for the moment. Please report visual errors.
  I will also release a version for the papersize Letter later.
  The PDF version is very nice to use if you'd like to print from HwB.
  It will produce great hardcopies.

Bugs:

  It works best with 64k or more colors. Please use the Windows v3.11 version
  if you experience this.
